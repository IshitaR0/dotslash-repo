# 24-Hour Hackathon Progress Report

### Date: November 24, 2024

## What Was Accomplished:
1. **Homepage (HTML, CSS, JS)**:
   - Created a **dynamic homepage** featuring a user questionnaire with radio buttons to select business size.
   - Designed the radio button options inside a **styled rectangular box** for a clean and structured layout.
   - Integrated **Clear** and **Next** buttons:
     - **Clear button**: Resets the radio button selection.
     - **Next button**: Redirects to the product page while displaying an error message if no option is selected.

2. **Product Page (maincode.html)**:
   - Implemented dynamic product display by reading from a **CSV file**, ensuring products were properly displayed in a **flexbox layout**.
   - Styled the **product cards** with a clear border and hover effects for a more interactive UI.
   - Corrected the layout issues and ensured all the product cards displayed correctly on the page.

3. **Bug Fixes & Refinements**:
   - Fixed **file path issues**, ensuring that all external CSS and JS files were correctly linked.
   - Added **visual enhancements** like margins and separators between product details (title and price).
   - Ensured the radio buttons on the homepage were properly **centered** within the form and adjusted the styling for a more polished look.

## Challenges Encountered:
1. **File Path Problems**: Encountered initial difficulties with external CSS and JS files not loading correctly. Resolved by correctly linking resources in the `public` folder.
   
2. **Flexbox Layout Issues**: Had issues getting the flexbox layout to work for product cards due to CSS file not being applied properly. Fixed by ensuring proper file structure and linking.

3. **Form Validation**: Initially, the **Next button** didn’t trigger validation when no selection was made. After debugging, implemented a **red error message** to notify users that a selection is required.

4. **Performance Delays**: Faced a slight performance issue with page loading when switching between pages, particularly after clicking Next. This was improved by optimizing resource loading paths and ensuring proper file setup.

## Next Steps:
1. **Product Display Enhancements**: Further improve the design of product cards, potentially adding images and additional product details to make them more visually appealing.


3. **Search Functionality**: Add search capabilities to filter products by name, making the shopping experience more intuitive.

4. **Backend Setup**: Explore a basic backend solution to manage products dynamically.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhance the website’s responsiveness for better performance across various devices by adding media queries to the CSS.
